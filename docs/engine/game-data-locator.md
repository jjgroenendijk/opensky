# Game data locator

`opensky/GameData/GameDataLocator.swift`. Resolves + validates the Skyrim SE install at
launch. Install is read-only external input — never bundled, cached, or copied
(AGENTS.md Legal & IP).

## Resolution order

First configured source wins. Configured-but-invalid override -> throws, never falls
through to the next source.

1. `OPENSKY_DATA_ROOT` env var — tests, CLI runs, one-off launches.
2. `OpenSkyDataRoot` UserDefaults key — persistent per-machine setting:
   `defaults write nl.jjgroenendijk.opensky OpenSkyDataRoot "<install path>"`,
   or the preview app's Settings window.
3. Default Steam path:
   `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim Special Edition`.

Setting lives in one shared defaults domain `nl.jjgroenendijk.opensky`
(`GameDataLocator.settingsDefaults`) — tools with other bundle ids (preview)
read/write it via `UserDefaults(suiteName:)`; the main app, whose own domain is
the shared one, uses `.standard` (suiteName rejects the current bundle id).
Same plist either way.

## Persisting a choice

`GameDataLocator.saveUserChoice(path:)` — validates, then stores under the
defaults key; invalid path throws and leaves the stored setting untouched.
`clearUserChoice()` removes it (next locate falls back to the Steam default).
Preview Settings window drives both.

## Validation

Path counts as install root when `Data/Skyrim.esm` exists under it. Path pointing at the
`Data/` folder itself (contains `Skyrim.esm` directly) also accepted — both shapes occur
in user configs. Tilde expanded.

## Result + failure

Success -> `GameDataRoot { installURL, dataURL, source }`; `dataURL` is the only root
engine reads go under. Failure -> `GameDataError` (typed, `LocalizedError`); AppDelegate
logs via `os.Logger` (subsystem `nl.jjgroenendijk.opensky`, category `GameData`) + shows
critical NSAlert with remediation. No silent fallback exists by design.

Probe skipped in the unit-test host (`XCTestConfigurationFilePath` env present) — tests
must not depend on machine state. UI-tested app instances still run it; smoke test injects
a synthetic root via `OPENSKY_DATA_ROOT`.

## Tests

`openskyTests/GameDataLocatorTests.swift` — synthetic temp-dir installs (empty
`Skyrim.esm` marker), all sources injectable. Covers order, both root shapes, fail-loud
on invalid override, not-found message.
